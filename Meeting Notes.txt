Meeting Notes:

Server Side:
- Server will be collecting data and storing to database every time interval (ex. every 5 mins)
- Issue: Osu! API 12,000 requests per minute limit --> Limits to 6,000 users
- Solution: User authenticates each time to request data collection
- API returns csv files
- Will need server endpoint to return JSON conversion of data to client 

Client Side:
- Requests data for specific user and pulls data from 
- Visualizations for stats will be displayed to UI (possibly use d3.js)
	Ideas:
	- BAR GRAPHS for comparing against other players
	- BOX PLOT for Accuracy from Specific Map
- Important fields from data:
	- Maxcombos, Accuracy, Counts, etc.

Roles (Main Focus):
- Matt K. = Server-side JS and database 
- Jonathan / Matt G. = UI Interface (HTML, CSS) and client-side (JS)
- Kathrina = User-authentication / Assist Matt K.  with server side
